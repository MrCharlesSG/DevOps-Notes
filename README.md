# DevOps Notes

This repository contains comprehensive notes and resources for preparing for the DevOps Kubernetes exams. The notes are divided into two main parts: MidTerm 1 and MidTerm 2, each focusing on different topics and practical labs related to DevOps and Kubernetes.

Additionally, there is a section dedicated to Docker Notes, which covers essential Docker concepts. These notes were presented to my colleagues as part of a study session and include fundamental topics like container creation, building Docker images, understanding Dockerfile instructions, and managing containers.

Overview
MidTerm 1 focuses on containerization basics, creating and managing containers, Dockerfile instructions, networking, and persistence, among other foundational topics.

MidTerm 2 dives deeper into troubleshooting, scaling applications, deploying web applications, and managing storage and application configurations in Kubernetes.

Docker Notes covers core Docker concepts, providing practical insights for working with Docker containers and images. It also includes guidance for presenting these concepts effectively to peers in a study environment.

## **Docker Notes**

[Docker Notes](https://github.com/MrCharlesSG/DevOps-Notes/blob/main/DockerDoc.md)

These notes are dedicated to Docker and its usage in a DevOps environment. I had to present this documentation to my colleagues as part of a study session. The notes cover essential Docker concepts such as container creation, building images, understanding Dockerfile instructions, and managing Docker containers effectively.
