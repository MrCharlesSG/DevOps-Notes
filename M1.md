# M1

# Lab 2

### **1. Connect to the workstation VM inside RH Academy lab environment.**

Assuming you're already connected to the workstation VM.

### **2. Find the latest nginx container image from Docker Hub.**

```bash
bashCopy code
podman search nginx
```

### **3. Find the documentation explaining the use of that image.**

You can find the documentation on Docker Hub or the official Nginx website.

### **4. List running containers on the system.**

```bash
bashCopy code
podman ps
```

### **5. Pull the image you found.**

```bash
bashCopy code
podman pull nginx (docker)
```

### **6. Find more information about the container image.**

```bash
podman image inspect nginx
```

### **7. Create a container instance in the background and map it to port 80.**

```bash
podman run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

The issue

### **8. Create an instance of the container and map it to port 8080.**

```bash
podman run -d --name web8080 -p 8080:80 nginx
```

If you encounter an issue, it could be because port 8080 is already in use. Resolve by stopping the conflicting container or choose a different host port.

### **9. List running containers.**

```bash
bashCopy code
podman ps
```

### **10. Stop the first container you created.**

```bash
bashCopy code
podman stop <container_id_or_name>
```

### **11. Try creating another container instance named web8080.**

```bash
bashCopy code
podman run -d --name web8080 -p 8080:80 nginx
```

If you encounter an issue, ensure that the container name 'web8080' is not already in use.

### **12. Inspect the details of web8080 container.**

```bash
bashCopy code
podman inspect web8080
```

### **13. List all the images you have downloaded.**

```bash
bashCopy code
podman images
```

### **14. Export the nginx image.**

```bash
bashCopy code
podman image save -o nginx_image.tar nginx
```

The difference between **`podman image save`** and **`podman export`** is that **`save`** exports the image along with metadata, while **`export`** exports only the filesystem contents of the container.

### **15. Command to create, modify, and save a new image.**

```bash
bashCopy code
# Connect to the container
podman exec -it web8080 bash

# Navigate to the directory where the HTML files are located
cd /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Backup the existing index.html file (optional)
mv index.html index.html.bak

# Create a new index.html file with your custom content
echo "<html><body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>" > index.html

# Exit the container shell
exit

# Commit the changes to a new image
podman commit web8080  web8080 -modified

```

### **16. Command to change the contents of the default web page of web8080 container without terminating it.**

```bash
bashCopy code
# Connect to the running container
podman exec -it web8080 bash

# Navigate to the directory where the HTML files are located
cd /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Edit the index.html file using a text editor (e.g., nano)
echo "<html><body><h1>Other Title</h1></body></html>" > index.html

# Modify the content as needed, then save and exit the editor

# Once done, exit the container shell
exit

```

Then you can navigate to the web page directory and modify it. For example, the default web page might be in **`/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html`**. Once done, exit the container's shell. No need to restart the container; changes will take effect immediately.

# Lab 3

## 1. Containerize an Application

Containerize an application by following the [Containerize an application | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/) gide

### Get the App

1. Clone the [getting-started-app repository](https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app/tree/main) using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app.git
    ```
    
2. Create an empty file named `Dockerfile`
    
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/getting-started-app
    touch Dockerfile
    ```
    

### Build the app’s image

1. Using a text editor or code editor, add the following contents to the Dockerfile:
    
    ```bash
    # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
    
    FROM node:18-alpine
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .
    RUN yarn install --production
    CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
    EXPOSE 3000
    ```
    
2. Build the image using the following commands:
    
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/getting-started-app
    podman build -t getting-started .
    
    # For tagging the image with 0.0.1
    podman build -t getting-started-app:0.0.1 .
    ```
    
    <aside>
    <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/light-bulb_blue.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/light-bulb_blue.svg" width="40px" /> The `docker build` command uses the Dockerfile to build a new image. You might have noticed that Docker downloaded a lot of "layers". This is because you instructed the builder that you wanted to start from the `node:18-alpine` image. But, since you didn't have that on your machine, Docker needed to download the image.
    
    ![ImagesUntitled](Images/Untitled.png)
    
    After Docker downloaded the image, the instructions from the Dockerfile copied in your application and used `yarn` to install your application's dependencies. The `CMD` directive specifies the default command to run when starting a container from this image.
    
    Finally, the `-t` flag tags your image. Think of this as a human-readable name for the final image. Since you named the image `getting-started`, you can refer to that image when you run a container.
    
    The `.` at the end of the `docker build` command tells Docker that it should look for the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.
    
    </aside>
    

### Start an app container

1. Run the container
    
    ```bash
    podman run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 getting-started
    ```
    
    <aside>
    <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/light-bulb_blue.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/light-bulb_blue.svg" width="40px" /> The `-d` flag (short for `--detach`) runs the container in the background. This means that Docker starts your container and returns you to the terminal prompt. You can verify that a container is running by viewing it in Docker Dashboard under **Containers**, or by running `docker ps` in the terminal.
    
    The `-p` flag (short for `--publish`) creates a port mapping between the host and the container. The `-p` flag takes a string value in the format of `HOST:CONTAINER`, where `HOST` is the address on the host, and `CONTAINER` is the port on the container. The command publishes the container's port 3000 to `127.0.0.1:3000` (`localhost:3000`) on the host. Without the port mapping, you wouldn't be able to access the application from the host.

    ![Images/Untitled](Images/Untitled%202.png)
    

## 2. Instruction for Dockerfile

[Dockerfile reference | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/)

## 3. Modify App

Modify the app by following the [Update the application | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/03_updating_app/) gide.

### Update the source code

1. In the `src/static/js/app.js` file, update line 56 to use the new empty text.
    
    ```
    - <p className="text-center">No items yet! Add one above!</p>
    + <p className="text-center">You have no todo items yet! Add one above!</p>
    ```
    
2. Build the updated version of the image
    
    ```bash
    podman build -t getting-started .
    # For tagging the image with 0.0.2
    podman build -t getting-started-app:0.0.2 .
    ```
    
    ![Images/Untitled](Images/Untitled%203.png)
    
3. Start a new container using the updated code
    
    ```bash
    podman run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 getting-started
    ```
    
    <aside>
    <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/warning_red.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/warning_red.svg" width="40px" /> You will probably saw an error like this
    
    ```bash
    docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint laughing_burnell 
    (bb242b2ca4d67eba76e79474fb36bb5125708ebdabd7f45c8eaf16caaabde9dd): Bind for 127.0.0.1:3000 failed: port is already allocated.
    ```
    
    This is becouse the other container is running. To fix this, you need to remove the old container.
    
    ```bash
    # if running
    podman stop <container_id or container_name>
    
    podman rm <container_id or container_name>
    ```
    
    </aside>
    

![Images/Untitled](Images/Untitled%204.png)

## 4. Difference between images

```bash
podman diff [id Image|Container] [id Image|Container]
```

## 5. Share the application

### Create a repository

1. [Sign up](https://www.docker.com/pricing?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs_driven_upgrade) or Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
2. Select the **Create Repository** button.
3. For the repository name, use `getting-started`. Make sure the **Visibility** is **Public**.
4. Select **Create**.

### Push the image

1. Sign in to Docker hub
    
    ```bash
    podman login docker.io
    user (mrcharleshr) and password (7S-Wvkud35BuK.Q)
    ```
    
2. Give the `getting-started` image a new name
    
    ```bash
    podman tag localhost/getting-started:tag mrcharleshr/getting-started:tag
    ```
    
3. Use the `podman push` command again. 
    
    ```bash
    podman push mrcharleshr/getting-started:tagname
    ```
    
    <aside>
    <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/warning_red.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/warning_red.svg" width="40px" /> Docker by default uses a tag called `latest`.
    
    </aside>
    
4. To run the pushed app
    
    ```bash
    docker run -dp 0.0.0.0:3000:3000 mrcharleshr/getting-started
    ```
    

## 6. Containerfile that uses `ubi8` as the base image

Create another Containerfile which will use ubi8 image as a base image. Update all installed packages and install httpd. Configure the image in a way that httpd is started as container is created. Name the image myweb and tag it 0.0.1. Note that the image is in a private repository to which you can login with podman login.

1. Create a new file named `Containerfile` in the `getting-starte-app` with the following content:
    
    ```bash
    FROM ubi8
    
    # Update all installed packages
    RUN yum -y update && \
        yum clean all
    
    # Install httpd
    RUN yum -y install httpd && \
        yum clean all
    
    # Start httpd when the container is created
    CMD ["httpd", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
    ```
    
2. Build the image and tag it as **`myweb:0.0.1`**
    
    ```bash
    podman build -t myweb:0.0.1 -f Containerfile .
    ```
    
3. Log in to the private repository where you want to push it
    
    ```bash
    podman login docker.io
    user (mrcharleshr) and password (7S-Wvkud35BuK.Q)
    ```
    
4. Push the image to the repository
    
    ```bash
    podman push myweb:0.0.1 mrcharleshr/myweb:0.0.1
    ```
    

## 7. Quadlet file

Create a quadlet file to configure the system so a container named web from image myweb:0.0.1 is with the system. There is a guide available at [https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/quadlet-podman](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/quadlet-podman).

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/light-bulb_blue.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/light-bulb_blue.svg" width="40px" /> `systemd` is a system and service manager for Linux OS. It’s designed to manage the startup, shutdown, and general operation of the system, including managing system services and daemons.

In the context of container management with tools like Podman, `systemd` integration allows managing containers as systemd services. This means you can control containers using the same mechanisms used for other system services.

</aside>

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/light-bulb_blue.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/light-bulb_blue.svg" width="40px" /> `quadled` is a concept in Podman used to define the container’s resource constraints. It consists of four parameters:

- CPU shares
- CPU period
- CPU quota
- Memory limit

This parameters can be adjusted to control how much CPU and memory resources a container is allocated. They provide finer-grained control over resource allocation and utilization within Podman.

</aside>

1. **Create the Quadlet File**:
    
    Open a text editor and create a file named **`web-container.container`** in the appropriate directory according to your setup:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir -p .config/containers/systemd
    touch web-container.container
    cd .config/containers/systemd
    nano web-container.container
    ```
    
    Then, add the following content to the file:
    
    ```yaml
    [Unit]
    Description=Web container
    After=network.target
    
    [Container]
    Image=myweb:0.0.1
    Exec=/path/to/startup/script.sh
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target default.target
    
    ```
    
    Replace **`/path/to/startup/script.sh`** with the path to the script you want to execute in the container.
    
    For the script you can do:
    
    1. Create the script
        
        ```bash
        nano startup_script.sh
        ```
        
    2. Add a command to be exec
        
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Hello, world!"
        ```
        
    3. Make the script executable
        
        ```bash
        chmod +x startup_script.sh
        ```
        
2. **Inform systemd About the New Unit File**:
    
    Run the following command to inform systemd about the new unit file:
    
    ```bash
    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    ```
    
3. **Check the Status of the Service**:
    
    You can check the status of your container service with:
    
    ```bash
    systemctl --user status web-container.service
    ```
    
    This will show the status of the service, including whether it's active or inactive.
    
4. **Start the Service**:
    
    Start your container service with:
    
    ```bash
    systemctl --user start web-container.service
    ```
    
    This will start the container using the specified image and script.
    
5. **Verify**:
    
    You can verify that your container is running by checking its status again:
    
    ```bash
    systemctl --user status web-container.service
    ```
    

## 8. Multi-Stage Builds

Clone git repository available at [https://github.com/jstanesic/example-go-app](https://github.com/jstanesic/example-go-app). Build a container image by using Dockerfile Dockerfile1 and tag it example:Dockerfile1. Build another image by using Dockerfile Dockerfile2 and tag it example:Dockerfile2. Check sizes of the images. Discover what benefits multi-stage builds has in use cases when application needs to be compiled.

1. Clone repo
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jstanesic/example-go-app
    cd example-go-app
    ```
    
2. Build Docker images
    
    ```bash
    podman build -t example:Dockerfile1 -f Dockerfile1 .
    
    podman build -t example:Dockerfile2 -f Dockerfile2 .
    ```
    
3. Check sizes
    
    ```bash
    podman images example:Dockerfile1
    podman images example:Dockerfile2
    ```
    

![Images/Untitled](Images/Untitled%205.png)

The explanation is

### **Dockerfile1:**

```bash
DockerfileCopy code
FROM bitnami/golang:1.13 as builder

# Install dependencies and build the application
RUN go get github.com/urfave/negroni
COPY server.go /
RUN go build /server.go

# Define the default command to run the compiled application
CMD /go/server

```

- **Benefits**:
    - The resulting container only contains the compiled application and its direct dependencies.
    - It's simpler and straightforward, as it only has a single build stage.

### **Dockerfile2:**

```
DockerfileCopy code
FROM bitnami/golang:1.13 as builder

# Install dependencies and build the application
RUN go get github.com/urfave/negroni
COPY server.go /
RUN go build /server.go

# Second stage: create a smaller image for execution
FROM bitnami/minideb:stretch

# Set up the application environment and copy the compiled binary
RUN mkdir -p /app
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /go/server .
COPY page.html .
RUN useradd -r -u 1001 -g root nonroot
RUN chown -R nonroot /app
USER nonroot
ENV PORT=8080

# Define the default command to run the compiled application
CMD /app/server

```

- **Benefits**:
    - It uses a two-stage build: the first stage for compiling the application and the second stage for packaging it into a smaller final image.
    - The final image is smaller as it doesn't include the build environment, only what's necessary to run the application.
    - It improves security by minimizing the amount of unnecessary software in the final image.

### **Comparison:**

- Dockerfile1 is simpler and suitable for small applications or quick tests.
- Dockerfile2 is more robust and suitable for production applications, as it produces a smaller and more secure image by separating the build environment from the runtime environment.

# Lab 4

## 1. Network

1. List all networks
    
    ```bash
    podman network ls --filter driver=bridge --filter name=podman
    
    # By using podman network command list all podman networks. 
    # It should only show default  network called podman with the bridge driver. 
    podman network ls
    ```
    
2. Inspect the network to find the value of the **`dns_enabled`** setting:
    
    ```bash
    podman network inspect podman
    ```
    
    ![Images/Untitled](Images/Untitled%206.png)
    
3. Create a custom network named labnet with DNS enabled
    
    ```bash
    podman network create labnet # is created by default with dn
    ```
    

## MySQL and Wordpress

1. Create a MySql db container named `mysql` using the official MySQL image ([https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql))
    
    ```bash
    podman run -d --name mysql --network labnet \
        -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 12) \
        -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress \
        -e MYSQL_USER=student \
        -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=DB15secure! \
        mysql:latest
    ```
    
    ```bash
    podman run -d --name mysql --network labnet -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 12) -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress -e MYSQL_USER=student-e MYSQL_PASSWORD=DB15secure! mysql:latest
    ```
    
2. Create a WordPress container connected to the "labnet" network and publish port 80 to port 8080 on the host:
    
    ```bash
    podman run -d --name wordpress --network labnet \
        -p 8080:80 \
        -e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mysql \
        -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress \
        -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=student \
        -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=DB15secure! \
        wordpress:latest
    ```
    
    ```bash
    podman run -d --name wordpress --network labnet -p 8080:80 -e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mysql -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=student -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=DB15secure! wordpress:latest
    ```
    
    Wordpress will be active in [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) where u re able to create a page.
    
    <aside>
    <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/light-bulb_blue.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/light-bulb_blue.svg" width="40px" /> If you repeated the previous two steps using the default network, it wouldn't work as expected because containers in different networks can't communicate with each other unless specifically configured. So, WordPress container wouldn't be able to access the MySQL container by using its container name. You would need to link the containers or have them on the same network to make them communicate properly.
    
    </aside>
    

## Replace MySql container with Data Persistance

### Bind Mount

A bind mount is a way to mount a directory on the host machine into a container. This means the files in the specified host directory are accessible from the container, and any changes made to the files in the container are reflected on the host, and vice versa. Bind mounts can be used to provide persistent storage for containers and share data between the container and the host.

```bash
mkdir -p /home/student/mysql

podman stop mysql
podman rm mysql

podman run -d --name mysql --network labnet \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 12) \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress \
    -e MYSQL_USER=student \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=DB15secure! \
    -v /home/student/mysql:/var/lib/mysql \
    mysql:latest
    
#version copiable
podman run -d --name mysql --network labnet -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 12) -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress -e MYSQL_USER=student -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=DB15secure! -v /home/student/mysql:/var/lib/mysql mysql:latest

```

### Volume

A volume is a managed directory created and maintained by Docker (or Podman) outside of the container's filesystem. Volumes are stored in a part of the host filesystem that is managed by Docker (or Podman) itself. Unlike bind mounts, volumes are not dependent on the directory structure of the host machine. They are managed and controlled by Docker (or Podman), making them easier to work with and more portable across different environments.

```bash
podman stop mysql
podman rm mysql
podman volume create mysql_data
podman run -d --name mysql --network labnet \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 12) \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress \
    -e MYSQL_USER=student \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=DB15secure! \
    -v mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql \
    mysql:latest
    
podman run -d --name mysql --network labnet -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 12) -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress -e MYSQL_USER=student -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=DB15secure! -v mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql mysql:latest

```

### Differences

1. **Control**: Volumes are managed by Docker (or Podman), while bind mounts are controlled by the user.
2. **Portability**: Volumes are more portable because they are managed by Docker (or Podman) and are not tied to the host filesystem's directory structure.
3. **Ease of Use**: Volumes are generally easier to use, especially for managing complex data and multiple containers. They can be manipulated and managed using Docker (or Podman) commands.
4. **Permissions**: Bind mounts inherit the permissions of the host directory, while volumes have their own permissions managed by Docker (or Podman).
5. **Performance**: In terms of performance, bind mounts may have a slight advantage over volumes due to their direct access to the host filesystem. However, the difference is often negligible.

## Podman-Compose

Some compose examples

- [Podman Compose Examples](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose/tree/main/examples)
- [Awesome Compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose)
1. Install podman compose
    
    ```yaml
    pip3 install podman-compose
    ```
    
2. Create a Compose file for WordPress and MySQL
    
    `docker-compose.yml` file example (the spaces count)
    
    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    
    services:
      db:
        image: mysql:latest
        restart: always
        environment:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
          MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
